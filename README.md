## References
I referenced Geeksforgeeks in implementing binarySort and mergeKArrays. I have included the specific links as a comment in the implementation of these two functions.

## Discussion on program and performance
I did not observe any compilation or run-time errors. The Valgrind report is clean. 

## Compiling and running
`make main` and then `./main`. Finally, run `make clean`.
